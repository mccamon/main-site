I am currently a lead teacher at Small Beginnings Montessori in Overland Park. Recently, I completed my Associate of Sciences and Associate of Liberal Arts from JCCC, and have also completed 90 hours in K-6 Childhood Education at Emporia State University. I have experience working in childcare and teaching roles, including serving as a teacher’s assistant to afternoon kindergarten classes during my senior year of high school.
