I am currently a Tutor and Youth Development Professional at Boys and Girls Club of Kansas City in Olathe. Earlier this year I earned my Associates of Sciences and Associates of Liberal Arts from JCCC, also with over 90 hours completed in K-6 Childhood Education at Emporia State University. I have experience working in childcare and teaching roles, including serving as a teachers' assistant to afternoon kindergarten classes during my senior year of high school.
