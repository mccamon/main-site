I was about to give up. Homekit was repeatedly loosing connections to devices, they might reappear for day and then vanish again. Bought and then sent back products because I thought they were defective, bought new ones and sent them back too. Wasn't sure how the whole Thread/Matter/WiFi setups worked together or not. For months I lived with it. Sometimes it worked differently on my iPhone than on the iPad. And then even differently on my desktop. Apple, why did you do this to me?

My HomeKit drama started when I decided to breakup with Ring. Paying $130 a year just to store videos when I already had an iCloud+ account for storage made Apple Secure Video really attractive. Replace the doorbell and a few cameras and after 18 months I'd be in the black. I already had a few HomeKit lightbulb and plug outlets which worked mostly, so I made the jump.

Every single camera I bought (Logitech, TP-Link, eufy) would work perfectly when I set it up. Then it would often(!) report Device Offline errors. What was super frustrating is I could launch the manufactures' application and the camera worked no issue every single time time. In the Home app sometimes the camera might surprisingly reappear and then fall back to offline mode the next time I launched the app. The cameras were on the network - why was this not working?

Contacting every vendor had the same unsuccessful troubleshooting tips and recommended fixes. Reboot the device and re-add to HomeKit. Remove the device and re-add it. Move it closer to the router. Reboot the router. Reboot the entire network.  Sometimes it would work for an hour or a day and then back to the flakey vanishing act.

Then after a LOT of sleuthing on the internet I was able to piece together the problem and a solution. It boiled down to the fact that my router (Google Fiber) does not allow HomeKit devices to communicate across its two different spectrums. What? My router, like most newer ones support both 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz radio spectrums. Most routers support both for higher compatibility with new and older WiFi devices. The router, mesh network, and my devices connect and then apparently and occasionally/continuously negotiate with the network for optimal performance. So what? Well in my case to make thing easy at home, I named both radio spectrums with the same SSID. So one network, right? No. Two completely separate networks with the same name.

The fix? I renamed the 5Ghz network to a different SSID and presto, it instantly started working. Perfectly. Every time. It was magical. Later in the day I moved some of our streaming devices that are not HomeKit enabled to the 5Ghz network; but in my house 2.4Ghz is for HomeKit devices.

In hindsight all of the troubleshooting fixes - and their ultimate failure to permanently fix the problem - made perfect sense. You might get every device on the right network, but then one, some, or all would start moving between networks since they have the same SSID. The video cameras were the first to go to 5Ghz which I would guess was done to ensure higher data rate for that sort of an app. The lightbulbs not so much.

Sadly there were not many tools to make troubleshooting something like this very helpful. You cannot discover which channel or spectrum speed your devices are connecting though or together. One of the few, albeit cryptic, protocol-level sniffer named "Discovery - DNS-SD Browser" for iOS did help to see the problem in action. Apparently HomeKit devices use the _hap._tcp and _hap_udp protocol to broadcast their availability on the network so the Home app can present the devices to the user. If your HomeKit devices are not listed the Discovery app, the device you are running it on and the network it's connected to is not on the same network as your HomeKit devices.

Given the problem and the solution it now makes total sense to me that lots of people have problems with HomeKit while others never do. What's frustrating is it seems like none of the technical support teams had any idea what the problem was or how to fix it.  And it's a shame there are not better tools for iOS to dig a bit deeper into network setups to troubleshoot issues like this for all of us. Now that I know, I can see why that older Hue Light stopped working or didn't respond to the switch sometimes. It wasn't the light bulb it was how I setup my network and the router.

And to think this whole wonderful journey started so I could save $130 a year. It was worth it and thank you Ring for encouraging me to teach myself a lot about how HomeKit works.
