My family and health are my most important priorities. For most of my career was an accountant until I was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2016. Following treatment I elected to restart my career in healthcare to service patients navigating many of the decision I had to make during my cancer journey. We laughed when our middle child Lucas returned home from his Peace Corps assignment in Rwanda. The first thing he wanted was a Jimmy Johns sandwich!
