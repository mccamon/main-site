When asked, I like to tell people I never climbed the career ladder, I took the stairs instead. Along the way I have done just about everything a person could do in marketing and management. Whether it’s launching lines of business in foreign markets, working to get competitors to build compatible products, or trekking around the developing world searching for where people get their water, I have been constantly on the move.

### Major career accomplishments
- Made Bluetooth a mainstream technology
- Helped over a million people get safe water
- Advocated social and institutional change as candidate for U.S. Congress
- Serial disruptor in the technology and non-profit sectors

For the past several years I have been semi-retired, ran for U.S. Congress, and now work for Virtual Management as a hosted leader of trade groups like the NFC Forum and OWASP Foundation. Before that I was on the leadership team that launched Matt Damon's Water.org personally directing grassroots advocacy and fundraising efforts while working tightly with Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube building innovative ways to connect with supporters. My role was to exploit the intersection of marketing and technology to help end the water crisis.

Over my thirty year career in technology and nonprofit I have directed teams that defined, product managed, launched and marketed dozens of new products around the globe. I worked in an internet startup (before there were such things), the Fortune 50, in International assignments all in the public, private, and non-profit sectors.

As the former CEO and Executive Director of the Bluetooth SIG, I was responsible for defining a business environment that creatied a $25B industry – one populated with component, system suppliers, end product manufacturers, service industries and iconic brands like Nokia, Sony, Microsoft, Intel, IBM, and Ericsson.

What’s my passion? Connecting people through technology. If after reading something here you feel compelled to write, drop me a line at mike (at) mccamon.org. If you’re an old (or perhaps new) friend, give me call during US central time hours at 913.940.2737. Have a great day and thanks for stopping by.
